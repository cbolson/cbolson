ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Bolson

I have been developing and designing websites for over 20 years.

I moved to Spain in the mid 90s having finished my media production degree at the University of Northumbria. 
In 2000 I began my carear as a web developer.

Since 2002 I have been working as a freelance web developer working with technologies such as <strong>HTML</strong>, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
